# Simple Rust Examples

A small executable to run solutions to the simple programming
problems found [here](https://adriann.github.io/programming_problems.html)

The idea is to have a simple way of adding implementations and trying them out.

The purpose is to allow rust_mission to learn rust by solving example problems.
